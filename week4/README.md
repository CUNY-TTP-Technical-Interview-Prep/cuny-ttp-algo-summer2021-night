## Dynamic Porgramming

### introduction

Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithm design technique for solving some of the seemingly most nasty problems you might face in an interview. The problem will often take the form:

Given a set of rules, find the optimal cost of some objective that is governed by those rules.

Which can show up as finding an optimal path through a maze, finding an optimal score for a game, or finding the number of possible outputs to a function. If you've searched the internet for tough interview problems, some of these examples will start to sound familiar. These are often labeled by interviewees as the toughest or scariest problems to be asked. Fortunately, with a better understanding of DP, these problems become drastically more simple.
