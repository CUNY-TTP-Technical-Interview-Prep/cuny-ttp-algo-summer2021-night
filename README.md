## Goals

1. Practice time and space complexity analysis
2. Get comfortable with problem identification
3. Review linked lists, hash table, stacks, queues, heaps problems
4. Build confidence in technical interviewing.

## Repo Structure

- This README contains your assignments
- The `assignments` folder is where you will put your work when you
  submit a pull request. This is also where we will post
  solutions afterwards.

## Assignments

Each hw problem is represented by an empty folder inside the 'assignments' directory. You're expected to complete two a day.

### Submitting HW

To get setup to submit homework, **fork this repository**.

Then do the following when you do homework:

- create your own branch git checkout -b "your_name"
- inside problem folder, create a solution file with the proper extension (solution.py/java/cpp/js) whichever language you're comfortable with
- write your solution inside that file
- commit your changes and make a pull request

## Whiteboarding

Students will be assigned to either group A or group B. Working as pairs, A and B will alternate roles as interviewer/interviewee and test each other on a random problem. Both groups will be provided with a set of 5 problems to choose from.

In your own IDE inside the 'whiteboarding' folder, create the problem file (ex: 'jump-game.py') and start coding
